# options-screener

This is the main code of the web app that can be found through the following link: http://options-screener.net

The web app is built using a data-science framework Streamlit: https://www.streamlit.io
Please refer to the streamlit link on how to install and run the code.

The data collection and manipulation script is not included as it has my sensitive information. However, I included pickled data that can be used to fully run the code.

Additionally, you will be required a token (free) from finnhub.io to run the Section 3: News sentiment, Price target, and Recommendation. 
Please copy your token to the config.py if you wish to run the Section 3.

I'd love to hear any feedback you have about improvements or more features I could add. It's a work in progress!

Enjoy!

PS: my machine specs: python 3.7, pandas 1.0.1, numpy 1.19.1, plotly 4.10.0, streamlit 0.66.0
